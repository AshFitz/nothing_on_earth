## Design Choices:
<p> The design of the site needs to draw the user in with hopes they stay and purchase the items we sell. The colours need to be appealing and compliment the the content and the product images. The site will have a feminine and elegant theme to help portray the produts we sell. The design will ensure the site is easily navigated which will result in users returning and signing up. 
</p>

### Fonts:
* [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?category=Display,Handwriting&preview.text=Hellop&preview.text_type=custom)
* [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?subset=chinese-traditional)
<p>I chose these font families for the website as they compliment the colour scheme, theme and the content well. They are easily readable and add to the clean and elegant style.
</p>

### Icons:
<p>I have used multiple icons from font-awsome. They offer a wide range of icons and will help the user to identify the buttons use. For example, icons were used for edit and deleting comments.
</p>

### Colours:
<p> I chose the colours below because they portray a feminine and elegant feel. They compliment themselves, the content and the product images well. The content is clearly readable and the site navigates well due to the colours. It increases the appeal of the website and UX. The colours used across the site are listed below.
</p>

* Primary Colour - White, #FFF.
* Secondary Colour - Black, #000.
* Tertiary Colour - Pink, #CB807D

![Colors](https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/blob/main/assets/images/colors.png)

### Images
<p> I selected images and a video that is in contrast with the theme of femininity and elegance. They help the user undersand the sites purpose and the we have to sell, they also help the user determine if this type of site and products will suit their needs. These images and videos were used throughout the site, the homepage, the product page, the product details page and the bag etc. The images were sourced from  <a href="https://sisterjane.com/">Sister Jane.
</p>

## Wireframes:
<p> The wireframes were created in <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">balsamiq</a>. This helped me to plan the visual look of the website. I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop.
</p>

<p> The wireframes for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/tree/main/wireframes" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

### Business Model

The business model for this store would be B2C, business to customer. This is because the business is selling the products directly to the customer.

### Marketing 

The site uses 2 different marketing strategies, social media and a newsletter that users can subscribe to.

- Links to the social media page can be found in the footer. The Facebook link takes the user directly to the Noting On Earth business page. Find the page  [here](https://www.facebook.com/Nothing-On-Earth-110107378460514). Facebook deletes inactive business pages, if the page has been deleted, find the images here . ![Facebook](https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/tree/main/assets/images)

- The newsletter sign up form can also be found in the footer. This service is powered by [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/en-gb/). ![Newsletter](https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/blob/main/assets/images/mailchimp.JPG)

### Search Engine Optimisation

## Planning and Testing:

#### Planning:

<p> Creating the wireframes really helped the planning of this project. It layed out what I wanted to achieve and you could visually see what was possible and what was not.</p>

<p> I took an aglie styled approach. I took time creating my user stories to keep within my time-frame and focus on the most important features and functionalities. I also included the acceptance criteria for each user story and tagged them based on their importance. If a user story began it was taken from the to do column and moved to in progress. Once each user story was completed it was then moved to the done box. I focused on not spending too much time on a particular ticket I was having issues with. I would move this back to to-do and try to complete the other tickets within the in progrss column. Using this method was brilliant for time-management. I was using my time well and at each point in the progress I had a clear understanding of the next steps and the overall goal.</p>

<p> A part of my planning was using <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors</a> to chose the correct colour palette.</p>

#### Feature Testing:

#### User Testing
<p> Testing was completed throughout the development process using chrom dev toos and user testing myself.</p>

### User Profile

#### Expectation

Users can register, login and have a personal profile that contains their saved information and previous orders.

#### Implementation

Django-Allauth was used to handle the registration of users. User profile model has custom fields when registering. Profile that includes the features, my saved information and previous orders. 

#### Test 

  * When not logged in: Navigate to the sign up page via the nav
	* When not logged in: Create an account and fill out all the required fields
	* When not logged in: Navigate to login page via the nav and fill out all the required field
  * When logged in: Navigate to profile page and view my saved information and previous orders.

#### Result

Users can signup and a profile can be created using signals. The user profile is interactive and the correct information is displayed.

#### Verdict

This test has passed.

### Products 

#### Expectation

View a list of products, see information related to that product, sort products by price.

#### Implementation

A products page was created displaying a list of cards that provide a brief description of each product, the name and the collection.
Within the nav there is also a nav item to select each individual collection to help improve the user experience.

#### Test

* Navigate to the products page via the nav and check products are displayed
* Sort the product by price via the select option box
* Click on the collection nav item to see that all links work
* Navigate to the individual products to confirm it displays all the product information 

#### Result

#### Verdict

This test has passed.

-----

### Reviews

#### Expectation

A user will only have the ability to review an item they have already purchased. They will only have access to review the product once. They also have the ability to edit and delete the review they have submitted.

#### Implementation

A review section is displayed on the product details page under the product image and product information. This displays reviews that the user and other users have submitted. This also includes a link for the user to edit and delete their own review. A review app is built inside the products app and if the user has purchased this item they have the ability to submit a review. This is handled by template variables and if statements to confirm the user has met all of the conditions, only then will a review form display for the user.

#### Test

* When not logged in, I navigate to a product detail page, the product detail page displays a message stating that I can only leave a review when I purchase the item.
* Register for an account or login, I navigate to a product detail page and a message is displayed stating that I can only leave a review when I purchase the item.
* Purchase a product and then navigate back to that product detail page, review form is diplayd and a review can be submitted.

* Toast messages are displayed when a review is updated or deleted. 

#### Result

#### Verdict

This test has passed.
