## Design Choices:
<p> The design of the site needs to draw the user in with hopes they stay and purchase the items we sell. The colours need to be appealing and compliment the the content and the product images. The site will have a feminine and elegant theme to help portray the produts we sell. The design will ensure the site is easily navigated which will result in users returning and signing up. 
</p>

### Fonts:
* [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?category=Display,Handwriting&preview.text=Hellop&preview.text_type=custom)
* [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?subset=chinese-traditional)
<p>I chose these font families for the website as they compliment the colour scheme, theme and the content well. They are easily readable and add to the clean and elegant style.
</p>

### Icons:
<p>I have used multiple icons from font-awsome. They offer a wide range of icons and will help the user to identify the buttons use. For example, icons were used for edit and deleting comments.
</p>

### Colours:
<p> I chose the colours below because they portray a feminine and elegant feel. They compliment themselves, the content and the product images well. The content is clearly readable and the site navigates well due to the colours. It increases the appeal of the website and UX. The colours used across the site are listed below.
</p>

* Primary Colour - White, #FFF.
* Secondary Colour - Black, #000.
* Tertiary Colour - Pink, #CB807D

![Colors](https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/blob/main/assets/images/colors.png)

### Images
<p> I selected images and a video that is in contrast with the theme of femininity and elegance. They help the user undersand the sites purpose and the we have to sell, they also help the user determine if this type of site and products will suit their needs. These images and videos were used throughout the site, the homepage, the product page, the product details page and the bag etc. The images were sourced from  <a href="https://sisterjane.com/">Sister Jane.
</p>

## Wireframes:
<p> The wireframes were created in <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">balsamiq</a>. This helped me to plan the visual look of the website. I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop.
</p>

<p> The wireframes for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/tree/main/wireframes" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

### Business Model

The business model for this store would be B2C, business to customer. This is because the business is selling the products directly to the customer.

### Marketing 

The site uses 2 different marketing strategies, social media and a newsletter that users can subscribe to.

- Links to the social media page can be found in the footer. The Facebook link takes the user directly to the Noting On Earth business page. Find the page  [here](https://www.facebook.com/Nothing-On-Earth-110107378460514). Facebook deletes inactive business pages, if the page has been deleted, find the images here . ![Facebook](https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/tree/main/assets/images)

- The newsletter sign up form can also be found in the footer. This service is powered by [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/en-gb/). ![Newsletter](https://github.com/AshFitz/nothing_on_earth/blob/main/assets/images/mailchimp.JPG)

## Planning and Testing:

#### Planning:

<p> Creating the wireframes really helped the planning of this project. It layed out what I wanted to achieve and you could visually see what was possible and what was not.</p>

<p> I took an aglie styled approach. I took time creating my user stories to keep within my time-frame and focus on the most important features and functionalities. I also included the acceptance criteria for each user story and tagged them based on their importance. If a user story began it was taken from the to do column and moved to in progress. Once each user story was completed it was then moved to the done box. I focused on not spending too much time on a particular ticket I was having issues with. I would move this back to to-do and try to complete the other tickets within the in progrss column. Using this method was brilliant for time-management. I was using my time well and at each point in the progress I had a clear understanding of the next steps and the overall goal.</p>

<p> A part of my planning was using <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors</a> to chose the correct colour palette.</p>
